      <p><b>1.</b> <font color="gray">(3 pts)</font> You are working as an analytical
         chemist for a company that is trying to design engine coolants that are more 
         effective in dissipating heat than the traditional ethylene glycol coolant.  A 
         colleague gives you a solution labeled &quot;Compound Y Solution&quot; that she believes 
         will have a higher heat capacity than ethylene glycol. </p>


 	<ul><b>a)</b> Use the Virtual Lab to generate data that will allow you to 
        determine the specific heat capacity of your coolant experimentally

	<p><b>b)</b> Is the heat capacity of Compound Y higher or lower than ethylene 
        glycol’s heat capacity of 2.200 J/g °C?</p>
	</ul>

	(The density of the Compound Y Solution is 2.78 g/ml and the heat capacity 
	of water is 4.184 J/g °C)

	<p>
	  <i>For this activity, we are assuming that no heat is lost to the environment, 
	  so you’ll need to &quot;insulate&quot; the glassware. In the Virtual Lab, right-click on 
	  a beaker or flask (Mac users: hold down the command key while clicking on the 
	  glassware). Select &quot;Thermal Properties&quot; from the pop-up menu that appears. That 
	  will open a dialogue box. Check the box labeled &quot;insulated from surroundings.&quot; 
	  The temperature of the solution in that beaker or flask will remain constant. 
	  You can also use the &quot;Thermal Properties&quot; box to set the temperature of a solution.</i>

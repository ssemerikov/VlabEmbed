      <p><b>1.</b> <font color="gray">(3 pts)</font> During the summer after 
         your first year at Carnegie Mellon, you are lucky enough to get a job 
         making coffee at Starbucks, but you tell your parents and friends that you 
         have secured a lucrative position as a &quot;java engineer.&quot;  An eccentric chemistry 
         professor (not mentioning any names) stops in every day and orders 250 ml of 
         house coffee at precisely 95°C.  He then adds enough milk at 10°C to drop the 
         temperature of the coffee to 90°C.</p>


 	<ul><b>a)</b> Calculate the amount of milk (in ml) the professor must add to 
        reach this temperature.  Show all your work, and circle the answer. 
	<p><b>b)</b> Use the Virtual Lab to make the coffee/milk solution and verify 
	the answer you calculated in a).  </p>
	</ul>

	Hint: the coffee is in an insulated travel mug, so no heat escapes. 
	To insulate a piece of glassware in Virtual Lab, Mac-users should hold down 
	the command key while clicking on the beaker or flask; Windows users should
	 right click on the beaker or flask.  From the menu that appears choose 
	&quot;Thermal Properties.&quot; Check the box labeled &quot;insulated from surroundings.&quot; 
	The temperature of the solution in that beaker or flask will remain constant.
	<p>
	(Assume coffee and milk have the same specific heat capacity: 4.186 J/g °C.
	 Assume that they also have the same density: 1.0 g/ml.)*

      The stockroom of the virtual laboratory contains a cabinet called
      &quot;Thermochemistry Solutions.&quot; Different concentrations of Reagent
      A and Reagent B have been placed into this cabinet.  You will use these
      solutions to answer the questions below.
      
      <p><b>1.</b> <font color="gray">(3 pts)</font> Use the lab to measure
        Delta H&deg; for the reaction that occurs when reagents A and B
        are combined:</p>

      <p align="center"> A + B &lt;==&gt; C</p>

      <p>Please note that each prepared flask contains 100 mL of solution.
        Also, you may assume the heat capacity of the aqueous solutions is equal
        to the heat capacity of water 4.18 J/g K&deg;</p>

      <p>Please describe your complete procedure and the key quantities you
        measure.  Points are based upon your final answer and whether or not you
        explain your procedure in sufficient detail for us to reproduce your
        actions. You are not graded on the method you used: all approaches that
        meet the above goal are equally valid.</p>

      <p><b>2.</b> <font color="gray">(3pts)</font> Using water and the reagents
        provided in the lab, create two solutions such that when you mix equal
        amounts together, the resulting solution has an initial temperature of
        50&deg; C.</p>

      <p>Please describe your complete procedure and the key quantities you
        measured.  Points are based upon your final answer and whether or not
        you explain your procedure in sufficient detail for us to reproduce your
        actions. You are not graded on the method you used: all approaches that

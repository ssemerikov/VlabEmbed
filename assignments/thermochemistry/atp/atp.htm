      <p><b>1)</b> Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the molecule responsible 
	for energy transfer in all organisms.  The energy transfer takes place 
	when ATP reacts with water in the presence of a biological catalyst called 
	an enzyme.  The resulting reaction forms adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and
	 H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>:
	
	<p align=center>
	Enzyme
	<br>
	ATP + H<sub>2</sub>0(l) &lt;==&gt; ADP + H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 
	</p>
	<p>As a catalyst, the enzyme participates in the reaction but is not consumed by it.

	<p>The Virtual Lab stockroom contains aqueous solutions of ATP as well as the 
	enzyme catalyst for this reaction.  Use the Virtual Lab to determine the 
	enthalpy of this reaction.   (Note the ATP is in an aqueous solution, so adding 
	water is not necessary. The components on the left side of the chemical 
	reaction are already combined in the solutions available to you, 
	but nothing will happen without the enzyme.  Assume that the specific heat of 
	the enzyme solution is the same as that of water, 4.184 J/g °C)

 	<p><b>2)</b> Using the information in the table below, calculate the enthalpy of the 
	reaction by taking into account bond breaking and bond making.  The chemical formulas 
	for the reaction are shown below.  </p>

 	<p><b>3)</b> If we assume that the bond energies are the same for the O-H bonds 
	in the reactants and products.  Based upon your experimental results, what can you 
	say about the difference in bond strength for the P-O bond from reactants to products? 

	<p><b>4)</b> When a biology textbook says &quot;Energy is stored in ATP&quot;, how is it 
	that this energy is stored? Please discuss.  (It may be good to discuss this with
	 your neighbors).

      <p>You and a friend are hiking the Appalachian Trail when a storm comes 
	 through. You stop to eat, but find that all available firewood is too 
	 wet to start a fire.  From your Chem 106 class you remember that heat 
	 is given off by some chemical reactions; if you could mix two solutions 
	 together to produce an exothermic reaction, you might be able to cook the 
	 food you brought along for the hike. Luckily, being the dedicated chemist that 
	 you are, you never go anywhere without taking along a couple chemical solutions, 
	 just for times like this.  The Virtual Lab contains aqueous solutions of compounds
	 X and Y of various concentrations. These compounds react to produces a new 
	 compound, Z, according to the reaction: </p>


 	<ul>X + Y --&gt; Z</ul>

	 The following activities will guide you in using this reaction to produce the heat
	 needed to warm up your food

	<p><b>1)</b> Use the virtual lab to measure the enthalpy of the reaction shown above.</p>
	</ul>

	(Note: the the heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/g °C)

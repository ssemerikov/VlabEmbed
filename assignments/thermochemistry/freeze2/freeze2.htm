      <p><b>1.</b> <font color="gray">(3 pts)</font> While working as an analytical 
	 chemist for a company that is trying to design engine coolants that are more 
	 effective in dissipating heat than the traditional ethylene glycol coolant, a 
	 colleague gives you a solution labeled &quot;Compound A Solution&quot; for testing. 
	 However, this time the density of the solution is unknown.  </p>


 	<ul><b>a)</b> Determine the specific heat capacity of the Compound A Solution using 
	    the Virtual Lab 

	<p><i>Note: You can find a scale by clicking on the tools icon on the left 
	   side of the workbench</i></p>
	</ul>

	(Assume the heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/g °C)

	<p>
	  <i>For this activity, we are assuming that no heat is lost to the environment, 
	  so you’ll need to &quot;insulate&quot; the glassware. In the Virtual Lab, right-click on 
	  a beaker or flask (Mac users: hold down the command key while clicking on the 
	  glassware). Select &quot;Thermal Properties&quot; from the pop-up menu that appears. That 
	  will open a dialogue box. Check the box labeled &quot;insulated from surroundings.&quot; 
	  The temperature of the solution in that beaker or flask will remain constant. 
	  You can also use the &quot;Thermal Properties&quot; box to set the temperature of a solution.</i>

	You work for a company that has many different research groups, and your group has just developed
	 a new food preservative which has been named &quot;Compund A&quot;
<p>
	Another group in your company has developed a new neurotoxin, which they have unfortunately also called &quot;Compound A&quot;
<p>
	An intern was reorganizing the chemical storage stockroom, and placed all the bottles 
	labeled &quot;Compound A&quot; on the same shelf.  
<p>
	You would like to begin testing the new food preservative, but don’t know which 
	bottle contains the food preservative and which contains the neurotoxin. It would clearly not 
	be a good idea to put neurotoxin into your food products. You have asked a theoretical chemist 
	what to do, and he said that the preservative will have a higher density.
<p>
	Design an experiment to determine which bottle of &quot;Compound A&quot; contains the food preservative.

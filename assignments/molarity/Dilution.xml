	<!-- An arbitrary number of realms can be specified here as the data
	  providers of the virtual lab.  Each realm must be given a name and also
	  have a valid driver file.  Other properties are specific to a realm's

	  documentation. -->

	<!-- For now, only one knowledgebase can be present.  The only required
	  field is the driver property, which should refer to a valid Knowlegdebase

	  specific properties which should be documented by that Knowledgebase's

	<!-- Loads the specified viewers.  The Driver property is required of each

	  viewer must also be provided.  One can optionally set the enabled state of
	  the viewer by using the enabled property with a boolean value
	  (default==true). In addition, any other xml parameters specified will be
	  passed into the viewer as well, so each viewer may define additional
	  behaviour on an individual basis. -->
